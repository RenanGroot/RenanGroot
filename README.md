<h1> Hi, my name is Renan! But you can call me Groot too 👋😁 </h1>
 
 My life's goal is to help people and solve problems 🎯
 
 I'm a Developer Enthusiast! Especially Python Enthusiast 🐍
 
 I've already done some Front-End projects (HTML, CSS, Bootstap, JS) and Back-End projects(Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy). Also, I've done C and Python algoritms in CS50's course 📚
 
 Currently I'm learning about Data Science, going deep in Data Analytics(Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, MatplotLib, Jupyter Notebook) 📖📈
